    <dt>Description</dt>
    <dd>Brian is on his way to Canada to visit his estranged father when the pilot of his small prop plane suffers a heart attack. Brian is forced to crash-land the plane in a lake--and finds himself stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness with only his clothing and the hatchet his mother gave him as a present before his departure.

    <dt>Example Review</dt>
    <dd>Some books imprint themselves on your mind and stay with you. You can remember vividly where you were when you first read them. Hatchet is one of those books for me. I remember being in Mrs. Alison’s sixth grade class, and this book was raging though the male half of my class like a wildfire. Even boys who usually hated reading couldn’t put it down. Obviously, as the class’s self-proclaimed queen of the bookworms, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about...</dd>

    <dt>Example Review</dt>
    <dd>When I started this book I was certain that the tone and style of book targeted it at children and teens. I was initially disappointed in the language and writing style used. I did finish the book and found that author got into the groove of writing and wrote better towards the end...</dd>

<h2 id="thedataweused">The data we used</h2>

<p>We used a subset of Goodbooks-10k from Github, which contains most rated books, their user ratings and all the tags users give them. However we wanted even more information so we can delve into text analysis. Therefore we wrote a python script to download and extract book descriptions and reviews for selected 3000 books directly from Goodreads. In total our dataset is ~100MB. You can download <a href="https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k">Goodbooks-10k</a> and <a href="">CSV</a> with book descriptions and reviews to try to play with the data. If you want to see more details about how we processed and analysed our data, you can find those in the <a href="">Explainer notebook</a>. </p>
