Multi-modality is king, and perceived annoyance is actually a positive, but only when considering Lh scenarios

	<p>Speaking signal words urgently</p>
	</section>
<aside class="notes">
They found that the signal word “Danger” was perceived as more urgent compared to the words “Warning” and “Caution”, 
which in turn were perceived as more urgent compared to “Notice”. Also, Signal words spoken urgently created higher
 ratings compared to non-urgently, which in turn were higher compared to words spoken in a monotone manner

<p>How to increase richness in tactile cues/warnings?</p>
<section class="slide level1">
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>Vary parameters such as rhythm, roughness and intensity</p>
	</section>
<aside class="notes">
Varying parameters such as rhythm and roughness (amplitude modulation on the original waveform that provides the vibration) 
of such messages enabled the design of richer cues without cost in their recognition accuracy, as long as a reduced number 
of different levels for roughness was used.

<p>In this study..</p>
<aside class="notes">
In this study, tactile cues are used along with audio, varying the rhythm of the cues, by imitating the rhythm of speech

<aside class="notes">
The words “Danger!”, “Warning!”, “Notice!” were added before each Lh, Lm and Ll. the ac- tor was instructed 
to speak messages of LH in an urgent manner, as if a loved one was in imminent danger. Accord- ingly, LM messages 
were spoken non-urgently, as if in a friendly conversation with nothing interesting about the situation and LL messages 
were spoken in a monotone, deadpan manner

The first experiment investigated the subjective responses provided by participants when exposed to the warnings.

<p>Set-up</p>
<aside class="notes">
participants were exposed to the 54 cues (6 A, 24 T, 24 AT) in a random order, to familiarize them with the signals. Afterwards, they were again presented with the cues and asked to rate them all in terms of PA, PU and PAE, by 
completing a 5-point Likert scale for each rating

Contrasts revealed that the significant differences in ratings of PU described above were not present in modality T

<section class="slide level1">
<p>From Experiment 1 it was clear that AT was rated higher in all measures compared to A and T, showing clear evidence of the usefulness of the designed cues when modalities were combined</p>
<aside class="notes">
Further, it was evident that the urgency designed in the warnings was reflected in their PU. PAE escalated according to PU, indicating that messages signi- fying situations of higher importance were regarded as more useful
