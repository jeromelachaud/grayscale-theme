<p>Auditory Icons</p>
<aside class="notes">
This paper looks at the affect of using auditory icons as a warning system in an environment 
where warnings are prevalent and plentiful, such as a control room or a hospital

<p>“sounds that provide information about an event that represents desired data“ -Gaver</p>
<aside class="notes">
Gaver describes auditory icons as sounds that provide information about an event that represents desired data.

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Aim of this study</p>
<aside class="notes">
The aim of this study was to determine the number of auditory icons that can be learned, in a control room context.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Procedure</p>
<aside class="notes">
The test subjects were separated into three groups, where the first group was tested on 10 icons, the 
second on 20 and the third on 30.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Training</p>
<aside class="notes">
The subjects experienced a training session directly before the testing session where they were able to here the 
icons while being shown what they referenced.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>What I found interesting..</p>
<aside class="notes">
One thing that I found interesting was the fact that none of their test subjects had hearing issues. I wonder how 
hearing impairments would come into play and effect auditory icons.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Testing</p>
<aside class="notes">
The subjects were tested directly after the training session, and during testing an icon was played to them, and they 
then had to match that icon sound to its referent.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Results</p>
<aside class="notes">
The results showed great success for the auditory icon warnings as 100% of the first group were able to correctly 
match the icons, the majority of the second group was able to match 100% correctly as well, and 93% of the third 
group was able to accurately match the icons
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>What does this mean/show?</p>
<aside class="notes">
I think that the important thing to get from the results is the fact that doubling and even tripling the amount of icons 
that the subjects had to keep track of had little to no effect on the subjects correctly matching the icons.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>10 icon limit in aircraft (Patterson and Mayfield)</p>
<aside class="notes">
This debunks the previously noted hypothesis that 10 or more auditory warnings in an aircraft context/environment is 
excessive. The subjects in this study were able to score almost perfectly with 30 icons even though they had little previous exposure to them.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>So why are auditory warnings so easy to learn and replicate?</p>
<aside class="notes">
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>According to Fagerlönn and Alm</p>
<aside class="notes">
who found that the use of sounds which are meaningful in the context in which they are applied can reduce the number 
of required cognitive resources compared with the use of arbitrarily mapped sounds
</aside>
</section>	

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Direct Relationship</p>
<aside class="notes">
 The aim of the study was to use sounds with a direct relationship to the object/event that they were supposed to represent, because direct 
 relations create rapid and immediate recognition of the target
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Indirect Relationship</p>
<aside class="notes">
 indirect associations are also an excellent alternative when direct associations are not feasible.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Further improvements</p>
<aside class="notes">
While I think that using auditory icons as warnings is a great application, I feel that there are still some ways to 
improve upon the practice. The paper mentions, and I agree, that involving the users into the design process will allow 
for even stronger relationships to be noticed and used when coming up with auditory icons. The users themselves are experts on 
their working environments and therefore may be very comfortable or aware of certain distinguishable sounds already. This would 
only make the learning process easier and faster.

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Issues</p>
<aside class="notes">
One issue that was noted was the incorrect pairings that happened multiple times.

	alt="Ref image" style="width:80%;height:80%;">
</a>
<aside class="notes">
It turns out that this is attributed to the fact that the sounds were similar, for example both 15 and 22 were 
similar to a snap/slam sound. This can be solved though by simply involving the user in order to discover similar sounds.

The study was conducted in a control room environment, but I can see this being very practical for many other environments 
as well including airplane cockpits, cars, hospitals, etc.
