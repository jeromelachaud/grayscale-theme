<p>Secondary Tasks</p>

The cognitive, visual, and physical demands of such tasks can compromise the primary task of driving

<p>Should we move to hands-free devices?</p>
<aside class="notes">
recent research has shown that using devices in a hands-free manner is no less harmful than the use of handheld devices. These issues must be coming from the result of taxed cognitive load

<section class="slide level1">
<p>The Goal</p>
<aside class="notes">
The goal of this study is to identify better and worse times for conversations during driving. Our goal is to 
better understand the interference between the cognition tapped for phone conversations and for driving.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Overview of Study</p>

	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>1. How is driving performance affected by participating in phone conversations where the driver has to interact 
	in varying levels of engagement? How do these effects vary with changes in driving difficulty?</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>2. How are phone conversations influenced by concurrently driving, and how do these effects vary with changes 
	in the levels of driving difficulty?</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>3. How does performance vary with requests to prioritize attention on driving, conversation, or both tasks?</p>
	</section>
	
<aside class="notes">
Our goal was to explore if and when opportunities exist when car drivers could engage in phone conversations without 
reducing driving performance, to understand which conversational tasks cause the most interference with driving, and 
the influence of increases in driving difficulty on interference between the primary and secondary tasks.

<p>Driving Task</p>
<aside class="notes">
Participants drove routes comprised of multiple 30s seg- ments, each segment having either of the following three 
levels of complexity: simple, complex, and unexpected occurrences.

<aside class="notes">
Phone tasks belonged to one of the three categories: assimilation, retrieval, and generation. The tasks were designed to 
resemble those that one may typically have over the phone.

	</section>

<aside class="notes">
For each route, participants were asked to distribute their attention across the two tasks according to the following 
focus (focus more on driving, focus more on phone conversation, focus on both considering them to be equally important).
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Measures</p>
<aside class="notes">
For driving performance, we measured the number of collisions, missed turns, and sud- den braking, and driving 
speed while talking on the phone.

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Results</p>

	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>Overall, users drove faster while focusing on driving</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>There were no significant differences across the different call types</p>
	</section>
	
	<section class="slide level1">
	<p>Being engaged in a complex secondary task that conflicts with the driving task in an obvious way may lead drivers to modulate driving speed in an attempt to ensure safe driving</p>
	</section>
<aside class="notes">
The overall rates of occurrences of events characterizing driving performance (collisions, missed turns, sudden brakes etc) 
were low. Just as distractions do not always lead to catastrophic outcomes in real life, we saw small numbers of costly 
events with the simulator

<aside class="notes">
Interestingly, prioritizing both tasks leads to response times that are not as high as the case when drivers were 
focused more on driving, nor as low as when focusing on the calls, indicating that there is some tradeoff in rapidity 
of response perhaps indicating an attempt by drivers to maintain driving safety.

Overall, focusing on driving resulted in reductions in accuracy on the post-experiment test. 
Answering questions on assimilation appeared to be more difficult, and retrieval to be the least problematic 
across the different conditions.

<aside class="notes">
This finding may be interpreted as evidence that when drivers are focused on driving, it may be more difficult to 
disengage and switch to a call, and drivers may perform more shifts in their attention to maintain driving performance, 
resulting in increases in silent periods in the conversation. The cognitive load associated with difficulty in switching 
focus and generating utterances may also contribute to the differences in the length of silent segments

<p>Overall:</p>
	
	<section class="level1">
	<p>Requested focus did not appear to have a major impact on driving performance, as automaticity seemed to allow users to drive and converse simultaneously</p>

	<section class="level1">
	<p>Focus did have a stronger effect on the performance on the conversations</p>

	<section class="level1">
	<p>Results suggest that large displays facilitate tasks with multiple windows and rich information 
	because they offer a more immersive experience, with enhanced peripheral awareness</p>

	<p>Larger displays promote physical navigation and improve user performance for search, navigation 
	and pattern-finding tasks</p>

<p>Take-aways</p>
<aside class="notes">
Participants occasionally were able to attend to each task effectively when confronted with one task when asked to 
focus on the other, suggesting that drivers may be interleaving the tasks. For example, even while deeply engaged in 
a phone conversation, the drivers were found to make subtle adjustments to their driving (e.g., reducing their driving 
speed to have more control) to accommodate the conversation without compromising safety. Also, the silent segments can be 
explained by users switching back and forth between driving and the conversation to ensure that the driving task was 
maintained.

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Future Applications</p>
<aside class="notes">
Intelligent systems might even one day impose a maximal driving speed or increase a minimal allowed distance to 
the car in front of a driver when an attention-soaking conversation is detected, thus generating more time for 
drivers to respond to events.
