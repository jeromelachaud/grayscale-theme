	Founded by Christopher Poole, 4chan is a online community much like reddit where users can leave posts, though 4chan is unique because everyone on the site is anonymous.

<section class="slide level1">
<h3>Users are anonymous</h3>
<aside class="notes">
Users generally post anonymously, with the most recent posts appearing above the rest. 4chan is split into various boards with their own specific content and guidelines. 
Registration is not required, nor is it possible (except for staff). Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards were originally used for posting pictures and discussing manga 
and anime, as the site was modeled on Japanese imageboards, particularly 2chan. The site quickly became popular and expanded, though much of 4chan's content still features 
otaku, anime, and other Japanese cultural influences.

4chan is interesting because it serves as a great example as to how a fully anonymous community behaves, where even users are unaware of each other.</aside>

<aside class="notes">
Unlike Reddit, which is pseudonymous, 4chan is fully anonymous, as explained by a Reddit user. Here we can see that this user has a username (profile) 
and therefore other users are aware of what posts this user makes.

We are familiar with the tor network, as we have discussed it several times in class. o	Tor can be a tangible example of what anonymity on the Internet 
can result in. The question is then, should users have the option to browse and use the Internet anonymously?

<aside class="notes">
You all remember generation like. Generation like shows us how badly some people want to participate. 
Social media platforms, especially those, which are anonymous, are a great way for people to join a community, 
potentially expressing controversial views or beliefs that they may have. The barriers that may exist for other platforms, 
mainly the connection to real-life, do not exist with 4chan.
</aside>

<section class="slide level1">
<h3>The Global Village</h3>
<aside class="notes">
The Internet has become a global village. The question is whether the strength of a community and the power it holds 
is used for good or evil purposes. Now, with 4chan's platform, we see an anonymous global village. This greatly changes 
the dynamics of the community because how can you help or look out for your neighbor when they are anonymous?

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Does the lack of rules make for the environment and the users and abuse, or did the users mutate the environment to suit them? Was it always this way, or did it evolve?</p>
<aside class="notes">
According to studies by (Kahai, 2009) 
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>"When initial opinions among group members differ, source anonymity leads to a lower incidence of counter-normative 
arguments compared with the identified or participant-anonymity conditions."</p>
<aside class="notes">
So, in a way the environment allows for less counter-normative opinions/arguments, but the users themselves define what 
they think is normative. It just so happens that their idea of normative is counter-normative when compared to the socially accepted standard.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<h3>Effects of anonymity on behavior in groups</h3>
<aside class="notes">
In a paper by (Postmes et al., 2001), a study on anonymity behavior in groups revealed that anonymous 
group members conform tot he standards set by a prime, whereas identifiable group members do not. 
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<h3>Primed norm socially transmitted</h3>
<aside class="notes">
This suggests that the primed norm was socially transmitted within the group. This helps to reveal and give reason behind the behavior of 4chan, where members of 
a group tend to become followers (sheep, riot crowd) when non-normative, or controversial arguments/ideas are put forward. It is because of the users' anonymity that they 
support or encourage behavior that would not be socially acceptable in normal society.

	<p>Nude Celebrity photo hack</p>
	</section>
<aside class="notes">
Not only is the site the place where hacked nude celebrity photos recently turned up, but it's also largely responsible for the GamerGate controversy, which has resulted 
in the online harassment and threatening of women in the video gaming industry.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<aside class="notes">
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<h3>Is the anonymous platform ethically ‘good’?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
We can see from the studies and examples of anonymous 
groups and sites like 4chan that significant problems arise from an 
anonymous community online, however, are these issues a significant 
enough of a problem to break up and prevent anonymous groups from forming, 
effectively waging war on privacy and the right to be anonymous in a public 
space?

Marc Andreesen, a major investor in tech startups had this to say about other, recently popular anonymous apps.

<section class="slide level1">
<h3>In my opinion</h3>
<aside class="notes">
In my opinion, while I am a strong believer that everyone should have the access to privacy and anonymity if 
they want it, I do see how platforms such as 4chan can enable nasty, and socially unacceptable behavior. It 
seems to me that the negatives outweigh the good with sites such as these, and perhaps some monitoring should 
be done to prevent major issues.
