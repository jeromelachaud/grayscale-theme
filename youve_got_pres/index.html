<p>Research Area</p>
<aside class="notes">
Head-mounted display have potential to improve the current situation of car drivers. With the system that was 
built to accommodate a (HMD), a dual task study was conducted in a driving simulation, where different techniques 
of content stabilization (head and cockpit stabilized visualizations) were compared. 
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Cars as a personal space</p>
<aside class="notes">
Cars have now become a personal space in which drivers want to relax and use their accustomed channels of 
communication and a comprehensive amount of infotainment systems. 
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>The challenge</p>
<aside class="notes">
As a result, introducing more and more functionality 
into the car while minimizing the negative effects on the driving task is one of the main challenges for today’s car manufacturers.  
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Drawbacks</p>
<aside class="notes">
One of the major drawbacks for most in-vehicle displays is that they require the driver to avert his/her eyes away from the street. 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to show/prove that (HMD’s) can overcome these disadvantages s they provide a very 
flexible FOV where content can be displayed regardless of the driver’s line of vision, while at the same time preserving all of 
the advantages of a (HUD) system

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Questions about HMD's</p>
<aside class="notes">
The main question I have about HMD's concerns their practicality. Why would users/consumers opt for an obtrusive HMD device when 
they could simply use an unobtrusive HUD?
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Goals of the study</p>
<aside class="notes">
The first goal of the study was to examine the effect of the content stabilization technique on driving and 
secondary task performance
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Variables</p>
<aside class="notes">
•	two different interaction modalities were compared (gestures and a physical controller)
•	two different content stabilization techniques (cockpit and head-stabilized)
•	4 use cases (audio control panel, a message center, incoming call and traffic notification center)
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Analysis</p>
<aside class="notes">
•	Used a mixed 2x3 design for the study
•	So half used rotary controller while half used the hand gestures
•	Although, all used HMD head-stabilized, HMD cockpit stabilized, and the HUD as a baseline

</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Measuring performance</p>
<aside class="notes">
•	After each test drive, subjects were asked to complete two standardized questionnaires (System Usability Scale and NASA Raw Task Load Index)
•	Subjects also had to complete several scenario-specific 5-point Likert scales
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Results</p>
<aside class="notes">
o	Generally the HUD condition tended to yield lower task completion times than the HMD conditions (significant in the phone task)
o	HUD yielded a significantly lower total task time than the HMD cockpit-stabilized condition and the HMD head-stabilized condition
o	In regard to the message task, the HMD head-stabilized condition yielded significantly lower task times than the HMD cockpit-stabilized condition
o	A significant effect of the stabilization techniques was found
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Qualitatively..</p>
<aside class="notes">
•	The HUD was considered to be more comfortable to read than the HMD cockpit=stabilized and the HMD head-stabilized visualization.
•	Subjects agreed that HMD visualizations suffered from unsteady presentation cause by head movements
•	One subject stated that he would prefer vertical gestures, because horizontal gestures lead to unintentional steering movements
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Practical implications</p>
<aside class="notes">
•	Surprised to find that the technology mature HUD did not outperform all HMD conditions, instead the best two SDLP values were achieved by HMD.
•	The difference is not significant and does not imply that one is safer
•	Regarding hand gestures, while longitudinal vehicle control did not significantly suffer from gesture interaction, there was a significant negative effect on the lateral control of the vehicle.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Applying the results</p>
<aside class="notes">
•	I think that the gesture part was significant because it showed how horizontal gestures might affect the also horizontal 
movement of turning
