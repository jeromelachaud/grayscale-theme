# Image of Google slogan, "Don't be evil"

<aside class="notes">
Google was founded with the motto to not be evil. This means that although they are a private company and resource, they set off with the intention of treating and providing their services as a public utility
</aside>

# Image of a product

<aside class="notes">
While Google may treat their services like a public utility, the issue is that their service is not in fact their "product." What then is their product?
</aside>

# You

<aside class="notes">
You are the product for companies such as Google
</aside>

# image of Google

<aside class="notes">
Companies like Google provide their services for free, in order to gather information about their users
</aside>

# You

<aside class="notes">
Such as you

# Image of advertiser

<aside class="notes">
This information is extremely valuable to advertisers who are more than willing to pay these companies for it
</aside>

# Image of the advertising system (targeted pop-up ads)

<aside class="notes">
These advertising companies then use this information to create targeted advertising which is much more effective on their end
</aside>

# Image of Google

<aside class="notes">
So now that we have explored why companies like Google are interested in gathering your information.. Why should..
</aside>

# We

# the 

# user

# care?

<aside class="notes">
We the user care? 
</aside>

# Image of Google

<aside class="notes">
If you personally have no privacy concerns witht the actions being taken by these companies, then why is this a concern?
</aside>

# Image of the NSA

<aside class="notes">
The concern should come with the parties who have access to this information
</aside>

# Image of the government (NSA)

<aside class="notes">
Both the governent and its agencies have direct access to this information that is collected by private companies.
</aside>

# SCA Act

<aside class="notes">
The government can gain access through a warrant, but most of the time they don't even need a court ordered document thanks to out-of-date laws that are in place such as the SCA act
</aside>

# Image of surveillence 

<aside class="notes">
The government agencies such as the NSA then use this information for surveillance and other possibly unethical actions..
</aside>

# Image of hacker

<aside class="notes">
This collected information that is just sitting inside a database is also susceptible to being hacked
</aside>

# Image of Target

<aside class="notes">
There have been many databases hacked recently and it seems that the trend is only growing
</aside>

# At the end of the day..

<aside class="notes">
At the end of the day.. it is important to realize that
</aside>

# You, the user

<aside class="notes">
you, the user, are not in fact the customer for these service providing companies
</aside>

# Privacy

<aside class="notes">
and although their services may be free, you end up paying for them with your privacy and private information
</aside>

# Conclusion -"Don't be evil" image 

<aside class="notes">
This is a relatively new dilemma and one that we must address in order to find an ethical line for the actions of these companies
and more importantly, enforce this ethical line so that these companies cannot take advatage of their ignorant and unknowing user base.
