In this paper, how drivers perform visual sampling on an in-car interface, specifically when searching through a large number of unordered visual items spread across multiple screens is measured</aside>

Kujala and Saariluoma (2011) found higher individual in-car glance durations by increasing the number of items per screen as well as increased glance durations for a grid-style menu layout compared to a list layout.

<p>Problem Statement</p>
<aside class="notes">
The problems experienced by this organization are poor channels of communication between 
the referees and assignors and an inefficient method of assigning and re-assigning referees.
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Symptoms</p>
<aside class="notes">
The symptoms of this problem are as follows:
•	Referees are unavailable for a certain time or day, yet they are assigned games 
for that time or day
•	Referees are unavailable for assigned days, and give late notice to the assignor who 
then has to find another referee to cover the game
•	The availability of the referees is unclear, which leads to the assignor having 
difficulty finding an available referee to cover a game
•	Referees and assignors do not communicate quickly or directly, resulting in scheduling 
problems
•	Poor communication results in referees and teams showing up to games that have been 
cancelled, re-scheduled, or moved to another field or location
</aside>
</section>

<section class="slide level1">
<p>Solution</p>
<aside class="notes">
In order to solve this problem, the following objectives must be accomplished. The system 
must create a better channel of communication between referees and assignors that allows 
for quick, if not instantaneous, responses or answers. The system must also simplify and 
optimize the process of assigning referees to games in order to reduce confusion and the 
effort that is currently made to ensure that all games are covered. The scope of this 
problem involves the relationship between the assignor and the referee, and extends to 
the management of the games, such as re-scheduling, re-assignment, and cancellation.

<p>Solution</p>
<aside class="notes">
You solve this problem by creating an interface portal that allows for easy access and 
use on both ends (ref and assignor) that also allows for quick and simple communication.

<p>My Experience</p>
<aside class="notes">
I feel that I am the best person to tackle and solve this issue because I have experienced 
the current, faulty system first-hand and am aware of all of its bugs and inconveniences. 
I also know what is easiest and most desired from the referee spectrum, and that is the 
ability to set availability, change their schedule, and pick up additional games.

<p>Is this the best solution?</p>
<p><span class="fragment">What about competitors?</span></p>
<aside class="notes">
I feel strongly that this system would accomplish the previously set goals, through 
effortless communication and interaction, the ability to set availability for referees 
and to see available referees for assignors is met. The system is also very accessible as 
the are browser and application implementations. 
As far as competitors goes, the only system that I am aware of is arbiter sports, which 
is only available through the browser and does not offer the ability for referees to set 
their availability, and in turn for assignors to see each referee's availability.
</aside>
</section>

<section data-audio-src="" class="slide level1">
<p>Impact</p>
<aside class="notes">
This system will have a strong impact because it will make the assignors life much easier, 
allowing them to more accurately assign referee to games, hopefully prevent no-shows and 
cancellations, and always have prepared referees at each game, ready to work
