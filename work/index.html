<p>Our Hypothesis</p>

Our hypothesis is: While demographics may have contributed to the election of President

Obama's election as President of the Untied States was a landmark achievement. He became 
the first black President of the United States and ran an exciting campaign that received 
a lot of attention and experienced a lot of momentum, especially toward its conclusion.

	<span style="color:red">66-32% margin</span>, the over-30 vote was basically a dead-heat (50-49% for Obama). Younger

<p>As it turns out..</p>
<aside class="notes">
As it turns out.. Obama’s race and the demographics of voters actually hurt his election, 
and prevented him from experiencing a landslide victory. As we just saw, Obama dominated 
the young bote and offered a change to Bush's debilitating policies, yet still experienced 
close elections.

<h1>Topic:</h1>
<p>Race <span class="fragment fade-out">& Age Gap</span></p>
<aside class="notes">
The race demographic therefore is the most important demographic when looking at Obama's 
election due to the fact that its negative impact overrides both the positive age gap 
impact and the poor approval rating of the republican Bush, which led to expectations of 
a landslide victory.

<p>What we found:</p>
<aside class="notes">
We found that an age gap exists, which Obama benefitted from. We also found that both a 
pro-black and anti-black bias exists and effected Obama's election.

<section data-audio-src="" class="slide level1">
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<aside class="notes">
Our finding is: Although the age gap and a pro-black bias might exist, and may have played a part in 
Obama being elected president, they are both dwarfed by the anti-black bias that prevented Obama 
from experiencing the landslide victory that was predicted and expected.
