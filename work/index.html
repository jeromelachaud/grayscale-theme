<p>Our Hypothesis</p>

Our hypothesis is: While demographics may have contributed to the election of President

Obama's election as President of the Untied States was a landmark achievement. He became 
the first black President of the United States and ran an exciting campaign that received 
a lot of attention and experienced a lot of momentum, especially toward its conclusion.

With bush's approval ratings in the mid 20's due to a collapsing economy and unhappiness

<blockquote cite="">
	&ldquo;Comparing Obama's 2008 numbers to Kerry's in 2004 shows how important the youth 
	vote was to Obama's margin of victory. While Obama won the under-30 vote by a staggering 
	66-32% margin, the over-30 vote was basically a dead-heat (50-49% for Obama). Younger 
	voters were thus critical to Obama's victory in 2008.&rdquo;
