### Gerontion

<div class='poetry'>

|       Thou hast nor youth nor age
|       But as it were an after dinner sleep
|       Dreaming of both.


|     Here I am, an old man in a dry month,
|     Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.
|     I was neither at the hot gates
|     Nor fought in the warm rain
|     Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,
|     Bitten by flies, fought.
|     My house is a decayed house,
|     And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,
|     Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,
|     Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.
|     The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;
|     Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.
|     The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,
|     Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.

|                       I an old man,
|     A dull head among windy spaces.

|     Signs are taken for wonders. "We would see a sign":
|     The word within a word, unable to speak a word,
|     Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year
|     Came Christ the tiger

|     In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,
|     To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk
|     Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero
|     With caressing hands, at Limoges
|     Who walked all night in the next room;
|     By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;
|     By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room
|     Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp
|     Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles
|     Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,
|     An old man in a draughty house
|     Under a windy knob.

|     After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now
|     History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors
|     And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,
|     Guides us by vanities. Think now
|     She gives when our attention is distracted
|     And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions
|     That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late
|     What's not believed in, or if still believed,
|     In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon
|     Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with
|     Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think
|     Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices
|     Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues
|     Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.
|     These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.

|     The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last
|     We have not reached conclusion, when I
|     Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last
|     I have not made this show purposelessly
|     And it is not by any concitation
|     Of the backward devils.
|     I would meet you upon this honestly.
|     I that was near your heart was removed therefrom
|     To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.
|     I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it
|     Since what is kept must be adulterated?
|     I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:
|     How should I use it for your closer contact

|     These with a thousand small deliberations
|     Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,
|     Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,
|     With pungent sauces, multiply variety
|     In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,
|     Suspend its operations, will the weevil
|     Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled
|     Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear
|     In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits
|     Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,
|     White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,
|     And an old man driven by the Trades
|     To a sleepy corner.

|                       Tenants of the house,
|     Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.

### Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar

<div class='poetry'>

|       Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire--nil nisi divinum stabile
|       est; caetera fumus--the gondola stopped, the old
|       palace was there, how charming its grey and pink--
|       goats and monkeys, with such hair too!--so the
|       countess passed on until she came through the
|       little park, where Niobe presented her with a
|       cabinet, and so departed.


|     Burbank crossed a little bridge
|     Descending at a small hotel;
|     Princess Volupine arrived,
|     They were together, and he fell.

|     Defunctive music under sea
|     Passed seaward with the passing bell
|     Slowly: the God Hercules
|     Had left him, that had loved him well.

|     The horses, under the axletree
|     Beat up the dawn from Istria
|     With even feet. Her shuttered barge
|     Burned on the water all the day.

|     But this or such was Bleistein's way:
|     A saggy bending of the knees
|     And elbows, with the palms turned out,
|     Chicago Semite Viennese.

|     A lustreless protrusive eye
|     Stares from the protozoic slime
|     At a perspective of Canaletto.
|     The smoky candle end of time

|     Declines. On the Rialto once.
|     The rats are underneath the piles.
|     The jew is underneath the lot.
|     Money in furs. The boatman smiles,

|     Princess Volupine extends
|     A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand
|     To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,
|     She entertains Sir Ferdinand

|     Klein. Who clipped the lion's wings
|     And flea'd his rump and pared his claws?
|     Thought Burbank, meditating on
|     Time's ruins, and the seven laws.
